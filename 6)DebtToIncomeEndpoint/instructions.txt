1. Modify the fastplaidapi.py file to include a new get endpoint for the debt-to-income ratio calculation called '/plaid/debt_to_income'.
2. Implement a get_debt_to_income function in the endpoint which accepts the Plaid access token (string) and monthly income (float) as parameters.
3. Modify the crud.py file in the services folder to include the get_accounts function which you have already implemented previously, as it is used in this function.
4. Within get_debt_to_income, first get all account data by calling get_accounts with plaid_client and access_token parameters.
5. Calculate the total debt by summing up the current balance of each account in the accounts list, but only if the account type is either 'checking' or 'savings'.
6. Check if the provided monthly_income is zero. If so, return an error message saying "Income cannot be zero".
7. Calculate the debt-to-income ratio by dividing the total debt by the monthly income. 
8. Return the debt-to-income ratio rounded to two decimal places in a dictionary format: `{"debt_to_income_ratio": round(debt_to_income_ratio*100, 2)}`.
